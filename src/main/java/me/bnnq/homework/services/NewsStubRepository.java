                "Acer reduces its sea logistics emissions thanks to biofuel since Q4 2022",
                "Acer has published its 2022 Sustainability Report, which highlights the company's achievements and efforts in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects. The report covers Acer's performance and progress in areas such as climate change, circular economy, human rights, diversity and inclusion, corporate governance, and social impact. One of the notable achievements of Acer in 2022 was the reduction of its sea logistics emissions by using biofuel as a sustainable fuel solution. Since Q4 2022, Acer has been working with its logistics partners to use biofuel for its shipments from Asia to Europe and North America. Biofuel is a renewable energy source that is derived from organic materials such as vegetable oils, animal fats, or waste cooking oil. Biofuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional fossil fuels. Acer estimates that by using biofuel for its sea logistics, it can reduce its carbon footprint by about 7,080 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of 1,550 passenger cars. Acer's use of biofuel is part of its commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The company has also set interim targets to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 60% by 2035 and its Scope 3 emissions by 30% by 2030, compared to the baseline year of 2015. Acer has also implemented various measures to improve its energy efficiency, increase its use of renewable energy, and promote a circular economy. The company has also joined several initiatives and partnerships to support the global climate action agenda, such as the RE100, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the UN Global Compact, and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). The 2022 Sustainability Report also showcases Acer's social and governance initiatives, such as its efforts to protect human rights, foster diversity and inclusion, enhance employee well-being, strengthen corporate governance and ethics, and create positive social impact through education, innovation, and philanthropy. The report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. The report is also verified by a third-party assurance provider to ensure its credibility and transparency. The report can be downloaded from Acer's website: [1](https://news.acer.com/).",
